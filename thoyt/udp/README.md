# Assignment 3 Starter Code

## GUI Usage

### Code

1. Create an instance of the GUI

   ```
   ClientGui main = new ClientGui();
   ```
   ```

*Depending on how you want to run the system, 2 and 3 can be run how you want*

2. Insert image

   ```
   // the filename is the path to an image
   // the first coordinate(0) is the row to insert in to
   // the second coordinate(1) is the column to insert in to
   // you can change coordinates to see the image move around the box
   main.insertImage("img/Pineapple-Upside-down-cake_0_1.jpg", 0, 1);
   ```

3. Show GUI

   ```
   // true makes the dialog modal meaning that all interaction allowed is 
   //   in the windows methods.
   // false makes the dialog a pop-up which allows the background program 
   //   that spawned it to continue and process in the background.
   main.show(true);
   ```

### Terminal 

```
gradle Gui
```
*Note the current example will show you some sample errors, see main inside ClientGUI.java*
